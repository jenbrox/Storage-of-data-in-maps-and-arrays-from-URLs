# Read data from URLs and store data in maps and arrays in order to allow the user to search by year, gender, and name in order to receive the ranking of the name in that year.   
## This program reads data containing baby names and genders from URLs for each year available. The user is prompted to enter a year, gender, and name and they receive the ranking of that name for that year.

I had to create maps for each gender and year, scanners for each of the URLs.
To populate the map arrays I had to call a method for each year and provided the URL scanner, boy Map, and girl Map. I then created two map arrays and stored each map 
by gender, respectively. 

The user is then presented with the choices discussed earlier, I used a switch statement to grab the information from the appropropriate map and printed it to the user.

This project was made for my _Advanced Data Structures and Software Engineering_ course.  
**Course Catalog Description:** Programming methods, software testing, and algorithm analysis. Construction, traversal, and modification of trees, heaps, and has tables. Sorting and searching techniques on linear structures including arrays and sequential files.
